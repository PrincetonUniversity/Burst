1. Results from simulating a diffusing fluorescent molecule through a microscope
   objective detection volume.
2. Each row represents a single detected photon.
3. The 5 columns are:t, Delta_t, It, Is, ellipsoid
   col1: wall-clock time of the time trajectory (s)
   col2: inter-photon duration (s)
   col3: total instantaneous ideal intensity (signal + background)
   col4: total instantaneous ideal signal
   col5: chromophore distance from the focus, normalized to Gaussian ellipsoid
